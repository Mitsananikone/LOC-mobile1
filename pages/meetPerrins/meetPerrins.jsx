            <b>Cary Perrin</b>, the current President of the Alvin-Manvel Area
            Chamber of Commerce, has a profound dedication to faith and
            community. Cary has pastored and been on staff at churches in
            Missouri, Pearland and Alvin. After experiencing significant
            personal and community tragedies between 2016 and 2018, Cary found
            healing at Heights Baptist Church. Inspired by the support he
            received, he felt called to start Living Oaks Church in southern
            Alvin, TX, to help others find real hope for healing through Jesus.
            Cary's leadership is marked by authenticity, compassion, and a
            commitment to serving those with real hurts.
